# Temp_measure_prototype

The purpose of the prototype is to measure temperature
at the location of the sensor and send the measurement data to the Arduino card for processing and display
on the LCD screen. The display shows the date and time, and the collected temperature data is sent
using a serial connection to a computer. The information received by the computer is processed and presented in graphical form.

The system is operated with the help of the keys included in the LCD shield. The keys are programmed
various functions, such as displaying the minimum and maximum temperatures, averaging the measured temperatures, setting the date and time manually and
browsing measurement results.

Used materials:
For developing this temperature sensor materials required is a Dallas DS1820 OneWire temperature sensor, Arduino Mega 2560 card,
DFROBOT LCD Keypad Shield, wires and 4.7kÎ© resistor.
